Introducing DocPilot, an AI-driven tool that turns PDF documents into interactive experiences. With DocPilot, users can upload a PDF and instantly ask questions, receiving relevant answers in real time. Weâ€™ll explore the technology behind it, the challenges of processing PDFs, and how DocPilot makes document interaction smarter and more efficient.

To build **DocPilot**, I used a combination of technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A flexible, NoSQL database that stores and manages the application's data, including user-uploaded PDFs and their metadata.
- **Node.js with Express**: This backend framework serves as the core server, handling API requests, managing user sessions, and integrating with external services.
- **React**: A modern frontend library that powers the user interface, providing a smooth and interactive experience for users to upload PDFs and ask questions.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database that indexes and retrieves relevant information from the PDFs by converting text into vectors, enabling quick and accurate search results.
- **OpenAI API**: The core AI component that processes user questions and generates intelligent responses by understanding the content of the uploaded PDFs.

Together, these technologies create a seamless platform that allows users to interact with their documents in a completely new way.
